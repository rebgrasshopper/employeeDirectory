## Introduction:

This is a simple employee directory built in reactJS. It allows you to view, search, and sort a list of employees.

## Installation:

This project can be accessed from any modern internet browser. To install the source files and run locally, download the GitHub repository, navigate to the folder in your terminal, then run npm i. You can then run the server locally via npm start. If the API call does not immediately return results, add a proxy server in the package.json file (i.e. "proxy":"localhost:4000"). This can sometimes be necessary due to CORS restrictions on the API call.

## Usage:

You may use this code in any manner that aligns with the GNU public license.
